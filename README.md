## Introduction

This project is a **Flask-based backend service** for **natural language processing (NLP) text analysis** (e.g., news, MBTI, etc.), integrated with **Anthropic LLM (Claude)** and **AWS services** to build a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** system.  

It allows users to upload data for **chunking** and subsequent **question-answering** through **OpenSearch Serverless/Provisioned** search, followed by **generative responses** using **Claude Sonnet/Haiku**.  

The system is **modularized**, including components for:
- Pre-configured **AWS policies and roles automation**  
- **Data preprocessing** and management  

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** This software is **not intended for production or commercial use**. It is designed **solely for research and demonstration purposes**.
